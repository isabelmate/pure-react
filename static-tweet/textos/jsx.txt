HTML Inside JavaScript?!

Why is React making those same mistakes all over again?
But... did you notice how there are no quotes around the “HTML”? That’s because it’s not a string.
The lack of quotes is not just a trick, either. React is not parsing the tags and converting them into
HTML.
I know, I know, it looks like HTML. In reality though, JSX is just a nice syntactic sugar over function
calls that create DOM elements.
So what is React actually doing here? How does this work? And why isn’t it terrible?

JSX Is Compiled to JavaScript
The JSX elements you write are actually compiled down to JavaScript by a tool called Babel. Babel is a
“transpiler,” a made-up word that means it transforms code into valid ES5 JavaScript that all browsers
can understand. Each JSX element becomes a function call, where its arguments are its attributes
(“props”) and its contents (“children”).
Here’s an example of a simple React component that returns some JSX

Example:

Here’s an example of a simple React component that returns some JSX:

function Hello() {
    return <span> Hello! </span> ;
}
And here is the JavaScript generated by the compiler:
function Hello() {
    return React.createElement(
        'span',
        {},
        'Hello!'
    );
}
